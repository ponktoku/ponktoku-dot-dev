I saw this on [Matt Fantinel's blog](https://fantinel.dev/default-apps-2023), and I got inspired to do my own version. I was supposed to write this in 2024, but I got lazy and never got around to do it until now.

It's easy to get stuck in an endless loop tweaking and changing your setup either just for fun or that extra 1% of productivity.
This feeling is similar to Gear Acquisition Syndrome where you want to purchase some new gear for that new feeling, instead of just focusing on what you have and making the best of it.

Enough talk it's time to get back to developing!
