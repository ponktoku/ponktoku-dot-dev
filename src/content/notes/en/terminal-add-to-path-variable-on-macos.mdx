Here's how to add a directory to your PATH variable on macOS in the terminal.

## What is the PATH environment variable?

The PATH variable is an environment variable in all operating systems (Mac, Windows and Linux) that tells the terminal where executable files reside on your system when you type a command in the terminal.

Developers commonly use environment variables in projects (usually in a `.env` file) to store sensitive information used by their applications.
Similarly, operating systems need to store information like full path variables to safeguard you from executing something you don't intend to execute.

## Step 1 - See the PATH set on your system

In the terminal, to see the directories in your PATH variable use the command:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

You should see a long hard to read string which looks something like this (the directories listed for you will differ)

```bash
/Applications/WebStorm.app/Contents/MacOS:/Users/danny/.console-ninja/.bin:/user/local/bin
```

Each PATH is separated by colons. But it can be a bit difficult to read and see each path this way so here is a command to format of the output by colon each on a new line.

```bash
$ echo -e ${PATH//:/\\n}
```

## Step 2 - System wide PATH or Shell specific path

Now you have a choice of adding the directory you want to add either as a system wide PATH or a shell-specific PATH.
There are a number of config files containing PATH information. Here are some examples:

```bash
# System-wide
/etc/paths

# Bash
~/.bash_profile
~/.bashrc

# zsh
~/.zprofile
~/.zshenv
```

## Step 3 - Add the path

Let's use an example to show how to add a path system wide in `/etc/paths` and in zsh inside the `.zshrc` file.
This is the path I want to add as a PATH variable:

```bash
/Applications/WebStorm.app/Contents/MacOS
```

### Add path as system-wide variable

To add a path to the system config file `/etc/paths` you will need superuser (root) permissions to edit the file.
You can do this using the `sudo` command along with opening the config file in a text editor of your choice. For example

```bash
# Using nano (basic line based text editor usually preinstalled on most OS)
sudo nano /etc/paths

# VSCode
sudo code /etc/paths

# nvim
sudo nvim /etc/paths
```

Just add your new path to the list above on a new line. Save your file and reload your terminal session by either using the built-in shell command `source /etc/paths` or quitting and re-opening your terminal.

Use the command `$ echo -e ${PATH//:/\\n}` to confirm that the new directory path has been added.

### Add path to zsh (shell-specific)

You can add a PATH variable to zsh in the `.zshrc` in your HOME directory. Find your HOME directory using the command `echo $HOME` usually it's something like `/Users/username`.

Create a `.zshrc` if you haven't already and add this line:

```bash title=".zshrc"
export PATH="/Applications/WebStorm.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH"

# Substitute the path with your own path
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/git/bin
```

Reload your terminal session and check for the new PATH added.

**IMPORTANT! It is very important that you include $PATH somewhere in that export statement, usually at the beginning.**

You might have some noticed that one of the lines uses quotation marks and both have the `$PATH` at different places in the export statement. Is there a difference?

## Aside - Enclose the path in quotation marks

It is recommended to enclose the path in quotation marks, especially if the path contains:

- Spaces (e.g. `/Applications/Some App/bin`)
- Special characters (e.g. & or brackets)

## Aside - $PATH at the start vs end

- Prepending (`/new/path:$PATH`) gives the new path higher priority. The shell checks it first.
- Appending (`$PATH:/new/path`) gives it lower priority. The shell checks it last.

See [Stack Overflow - $PATH at the beginning or end of a PATH variable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25235357/path-at-end-or-beginning-of-path-export-in-bash-profile-for-git-on-mac)

**Is there a case where the priority would matter?**

You may accidentally override system commands. If you prepend a path that contains custom versions of common commands like `ls` or `cd` you could run the wrong binary without realising it or break scripts that rely on expected behaviour of the system command.

A comment by Magnus BÃ¤ck from that Stack Overflow thread.

> Paths are evaluated in the order given. One should also be weary that listing too many uncommon special-case paths before commonly used ones like /bin and /usr/bin could have a performance impact (especially if network file systems are involved). I only prepend paths if I really need to override existing commands, which is quite uncommon.
